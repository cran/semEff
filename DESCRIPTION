Description: Provides functionality to automatically calculate direct, indirect, 
    and total effects for piecewise structural equation models, comprising lists
    of fitted models representing structured equations (Lefcheck 2016 
    <doi:10/f8s8rb>). Confidence intervals are provided via bootstrapping.
